# Mapping Accessibility on Campus: A GIS Study of ADA-Compliant Pathways at FSU

This project analyzes pedestrian accessibility across Florida State University’s campus using GIS, spatial data, and Python automation. The goal is to identify ADA-compliant pathways, assess slope and surface challenges, and generate visual tools that highlight accessibility conditions across campus.

---

##  Goals

- Analyze pedestrian pathways for ADA compliance based on slope and other attributes
- Automate spatial data cleaning, classification, and visualization with Python
- Generate clear visual outputs: maps, reports, or dashboards
- Build a portfolio-worthy GIS and automation project

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: geopandas, rasterio, shapely, pandas, folium, matplotlib
- **GIS Platforms**: QGIS or ArcGIS Pro (for manual inspection or export)
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Exploratory analysis and documentation
- **GitHub**: Version control and portfolio hosting

 ## Roadmap

- [x] Set up project structure and environment
- [ ] Collect spatial datasets (paths, elevation, building footprints)
- [ ] Write Python script to analyze slopes and classify accessibility
- [ ] Generate automated maps and reports
- [ ] Optional: build an interactive map or dashboard
- [ ] Final polish and documentation
